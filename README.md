# WeatherAppAngular

The Angular CLI weather app project is a web application that allows users to search for and display the current weather information for a specific city.

Upon entering the name of a city, the application will retrieve and display the latest weather information for that city. Users can also search for multiple cities, and each city will be rendered. This allows users to view the weather information for multiple cities at the same time.

In addition, the application provides the ability for users to delete a selected city.
